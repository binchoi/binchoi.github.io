I am a Software Engineer (Server) at Buzzvil, where I design, develop, and maintain servers written in Go and Python. I am also a Computer Science student at Yale-NUS College, currently on leave to complete South Korean National Service.

I am fascinated by concurrent and distributed systems. I am also interested in Domain-Driven Design and Software Architecture. I am the recipient of the Yale-NUS Global Leaders Scholarship in 2019. I founded [Project PELA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pe-la/) (Programming for Education and Leadership in Afghanistan) â€” a non-profit mentorship platform that connects aspiring Afghan programmers to experienced developers across the globe.

Before moving to Singapore, I lived in the UAE and Qatar for 14 years.
